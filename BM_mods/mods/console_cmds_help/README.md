# Help for console commands
This is not a mod. It's a program to generate help for the console commands in different formats.  
You can find detailed help for all commands **[here](https://github.com/coyote963/bm-boilerplate#additional-server-commands-you-can-send-these-packets-via-rcon-besides-the-request-data-ones)**.
